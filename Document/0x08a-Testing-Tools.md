# Testing Tools

To perform security testing different tools are available in order to be able to manipulate requests and responses, decompile apps, investigate the behavior of running apps and other test cases and automate them.

> The MASTG project has no preference in any of the tools below, or in promoting or selling any of the tools. All tools below have been verified if they are "alive", meaning that updates have been pushed recently. Nevertheless, not all tools have been used/tested by the authors, but they might still be useful when analyzing a mobile app. The listing is sorted in alphabetical order. The list is also pointing out commercial tools.

> Disclaimer: At the time of writing, we ensure that the tools being used in the MASTG examples are properly working. However, the tools might be broken or not work properly depending on your OS version of both your host computer and your test device. The functioning of the tooling can be further impeded by whether you're using a rooted/jailbroken device, the specific version of the rooting/jailbreak method and/or the version of the tool. The MASTG does not take any responsibility over the working status of the tools. If you find a broken tool or example, please search or file an issue in the tool original page, e.g. in the GitHub issues page.

## Tools for all Platforms

### Angr

#### Angr (Android)

Angr is a Python framework for analyzing binaries. It is useful for both static and dynamic symbolic ("concolic") analysis. In other words: given a binary and a requested state, Angr will try to get to that state, using formal methods (a technique used for static code analysis) to find a path, as well as brute forcing. Using angr to get to the requested state is often much faster than taking manual steps for debugging and searching the path towards the required state. Angr operates on the VEX intermediate language and comes with a loader for ELF/ARM binaries, so it is perfect for dealing with native code, such as native Android binaries.

Angr allows for disassembly, program instrumentation, symbolic execution, control-flow analysis, data-dependency analysis, decompilation and more, given a large set of plugins.

Since version 8, Angr is based on Python 3, and can be installed with pip on \*nix operating systems, macOS and Windows:

```bash
pip install angr
```

> Some of angr's dependencies contain forked versions of the Python modules Z3 and PyVEX, which would overwrite the original versions. If you're using those modules for anything else, you should create a dedicated virtual environment with [Virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html "Virtualenv documentation"). Alternatively, you can always use the provided docker container. See the [installation guide](https://docs.angr.io/introductory-errata/install "angr Installation Guide") for more details.

Comprehensive documentation, including an installation guide, tutorials, and usage examples are available on [Angr's Gitbooks page](https://docs.angr.io/ "angr"). A complete [API reference](https://angr.io/api-doc/ "angr API") is also available.

You can use angr from a Python REPL - such as iPython - or script your approaches. Although angr has a bit of a steep learning curve, we do recommend using it when you want to brute force your way to a given state of an executable. Please see the "[Symbolic Execution](0x05c-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering.md#symbolic-execution "Symbolic Execution")" section of the "Reverse Engineering and Tampering" chapter as a great example on how this can work.

### Frida

[Frida](https://www.frida.re "Frida") is a free and open source dynamic code instrumentation toolkit written by Ole André Vadla Ravnås that works by injecting the [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) JavaScript engine (previously [Duktape](https://duktape.org/ "Duktape JavaScript Engine") and [V8](https://v8.dev/docs "V8 JavaScript Engine")) into the instrumented process. Frida lets you execute snippets of JavaScript into native apps on Android and iOS (as well as on [other platforms](https://www.frida.re/docs/home/ "So what is Frida, exactly?")).

To install Frida locally, simply run:

```bash
pip install frida-tools
```

Or refer to the [installation page](https://www.frida.re/docs/installation/ "Frida Installation") for more details.

Code can be injected in several ways. For example, Xposed permanently modifies the Android app loader, providing hooks for running your own code every time a new process is started.
In contrast, Frida implements code injection by writing code directly into the process memory. When attached to a running app:

- Frida uses ptrace to hijack a thread of a running process. This thread is used to allocate a chunk of memory and populate it with a mini-bootstrapper.
- The bootstrapper starts a fresh thread, connects to the Frida debugging server that's running on the device, and loads a shared library that contains the Frida agent (`frida-agent.so`).
- The agent establishes a bi-directional communication channel back to the tool (e.g. the Frida REPL or your custom Python script).
- The hijacked thread resumes after being restored to its original state, and process execution continues as usual.

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x04/frida.png" width="100%" />

- _Frida Architecture, source: [https://www.frida.re/docs/hacking/](https://www.frida.re/docs/hacking "Frida - Hacking")_

Frida offers three modes of operation:

1. Injected: this is the most common scenario when frida-server is running as a daemon in the iOS or Android device. frida-core is exposed over TCP, listening on localhost:27042 by default. Running in this mode is not possible on devices that are not rooted or jailbroken.
2. Embedded: this is the case when your device is not rooted nor jailbroken (you cannot use ptrace as an unprivileged user), you're responsible for the injection of the [frida-gadget](https://www.frida.re/docs/gadget/ "Frida Gadget") library by embedding it into your app, manually or via third-party tools such as [Objection](#objection).
3. Preloaded: similar to `LD_PRELOAD` or `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`. You can configure the frida-gadget to run autonomously and load a script from the filesystem (e.g. path relative to where the Gadget binary resides).

Independently of the chosen mode, you can make use of the [Frida JavaScript APIs](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/ "Frida JavaScript APIs") to interact with the running process and its memory. Some of the fundamental APIs are:

- [Interceptor](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#interceptor "Interceptor"): When using the Interceptor API, Frida injects a trampoline (aka in-line hooking) at the function prologue which provokes a redirection to our custom code, executes our code, and returns to the original function. Note that while very effective for our purpose, this introduces a considerable overhead (due to the trampoline related jumping and context switching) and cannot be considered transparent as it overwrites the original code and acts similar to a debugger (putting breakpoints) and therefore can be detected in a similar manner, e.g. by applications that periodically checksum their own code.
- [Stalker](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#stalker "Stalker"): If your tracing requirements include transparency, performance and high granularity, Stalker should be your API of choice. When tracing code with the Stalker API, Frida leverages just-in-time dynamic recompilation (by using [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/ "Capstone")): when a thread is about to execute its next instructions, Stalker allocates some memory, copies the original code over, and interlaces the copy with your custom code for instrumentation. Finally, it executes the copy (leaving the original code untouched, and therefore avoiding any anti-debugging checks). This approach increases instrumentation performance considerably and allows for very high granularity when tracing (e.g. by tracing exclusively CALL or RET instructions). You can learn more in-depth details in [the blog post "Anatomy of a code tracer" by Frida's creator Ole](https://medium.com/@oleavr/anatomy-of-a-code-tracer-b081aadb0df8 "Anatomy of a code tracer") [#vadla]. Some examples of use for Stalker are, for example [who-does-it-call](https://codeshare.frida.re/@oleavr/who-does-it-call/ "who-does-it-call") or [diff-calls](https://github.com/frida/frida-presentations/blob/master/R2Con2017/01-basics/02-diff-calls.js "diff-calls").
- [Java](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#java "Java"): When working on Android you can use this API to enumerate loaded classes, enumerate class loaders, create and use specific class instances, enumerate live instances of classes by scanning the heap, etc.
- [ObjC](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#objc "ObjC"): When working on iOS you can use this API to get a mapping of all registered classes, register or use specific class or protocol instances, enumerate live instances of classes by scanning the heap, etc.

Frida also provides a couple of simple tools built on top of the Frida API and available right from your terminal after installing frida-tools via pip. For instance:

- You can use the [Frida CLI](https://www.frida.re/docs/frida-cli/ "Frida CLI") (`frida`) for quick script prototyping and try/error scenarios.
- [`frida-ps`](https://www.frida.re/docs/frida-ps/ "frida-ps") to obtain a list of all apps (or processes) running on the device including their names, identifiers and PIDs.
- [`frida-ls-devices`](https://www.frida.re/docs/frida-ls-devices/ "frida-ls-devices") to list your connected devices running Frida servers or agents.
- [`frida-trace`](https://www.frida.re/docs/frida-trace/ "frida-trace") to quickly trace methods that are part of an iOS app or that are implemented inside an Android native library.

In addition, you'll also find several open source Frida-based tools, such as:

- [Passionfruit](https://github.com/chaitin/passionfruit "Passionfruit"): an iOS app blackbox assessment tool.
- [Fridump](https://github.com/Nightbringer21/fridump "fridump"): a memory dumping tool for both Android and iOS.
- [Objection](https://github.com/sensepost/objection "objection"): a runtime mobile security assessment framework.
- [r2frida](https://github.com/nowsecure/r2frida "r2frida"): a project merging the powerful reverse engineering capabilities of radare2 with the dynamic instrumentation toolkit of Frida.
- [jnitrace](https://github.com/chame1eon/jnitrace "jnitrace"): a tool for tracing usage of the Android JNI runtime methods by a native library.

We will be using all of these tools throughout the guide.

You can use these tools as-is, tweak them to your needs, or take as excellent examples on how to use the APIs. Having them as an example is very helpful when you write your own hooking scripts or when you build introspection tools to support your reverse engineering workflow.

#### Frida for Android

Frida supports interaction with the Android Java runtime though the [Java API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#java "Frida - Java API"). You'll be able to hook and call both Java and native functions inside the process and its native libraries. Your JavaScript snippets have full access to memory, e.g. to read and/or write any structured data.

Here are some tasks that Frida APIs offers and are relevant or exclusive on Android:

- Instantiate Java objects and call static and non-static class methods ([Java API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#java "Frida - Java API")).
- Replace Java method implementations ([Java API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#java "Frida - Java API")).
- Enumerate live instances of specific classes by scanning the Java heap ([Java API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#java "Frida - Java API")).
- Scan process memory for occurrences of a string ([Memory API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#memory "Frida - Memory API")).
- Intercept native function calls to run your own code at function entry and exit ([Interceptor API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#interceptor "Frida - Interceptor API")).

Remember that on Android, you can also benefit from the built-in tools provided when installing Frida, that includes the Frida CLI (`frida`), `frida-ps`, `frida-ls-devices` and `frida-trace`, to name some of them.

Frida is often compared to Xposed, however this comparison is far from fair as both frameworks were designed with different goals in mind. This is important to understand as an app security tester so that you can know which framework to use in which situation:

- Frida is standalone, all you need is to run the frida-server binary from a known location in your target Android device (see "Installing Frida" below). This means that, in contrast to Xposed, it is not _deep_ installed in the target OS.
- Reversing an app is an iterative process. As a consequence of the previous point, you obtain a shorter feedback loop when testing as you don't need to (soft) reboot to apply or simply update your hooks. So you might prefer to use Xposed when implementing more permanent hooks.
- You may inject and update your Frida JavaScript code on the fly at any point during the runtime of your process (similarly to Cycript on iOS). This way you can perform the so-called _early instrumentation_ by letting Frida spawn your app or you may prefer to attach to a running app that you might have brought to a certain state.
- Frida is able to handle both Java as well as native code (JNI), allowing you to modify both of them. This is unfortunately a limitation of Xposed which lacks of native code support.

> Note that Xposed, as of early 2019, does not work on Android 9 (API level 28) yet.

##### Installing Frida on Android

In order to set up Frida on your Android device:

- If your device is not rooted, you can also use Frida, please refer to section "[Dynamic Analysis on Non-Rooted Devices](0x05c-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering.md#dynamic-analysis-on-non-rooted-devices "Dynamic Analysis on Non-Rooted Devices")" of the "Reverse Engineering and Tampering" chapter.
- If you have a rooted device, simply follow the [official instructions](https://www.frida.re/docs/android/ "Frida - Setting up your Android device") or follow the hints below.

We assume a rooted device here unless otherwise noted. Download the frida-server binary from the [Frida releases page](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases). Make sure that you download the right frida-server binary for the architecture of your Android device or emulator: x86, x86_64, arm or arm64. Make sure that the server version (at least the major version number) matches the version of your local Frida installation. PyPI usually installs the latest version of Frida. If you're unsure which version is installed, you can check with the Frida command line tool:

```bash
frida --version
```

Or you can run the following command to automatically detect Frida version and download the right frida-server binary:

```bash
wget https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/$(frida --version)/frida-server-$(frida --version)-android-arm.xz
```

Copy frida-server to the device and run it:

```bash
adb push frida-server /data/local/tmp/
adb shell "chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server"
adb shell "su -c /data/local/tmp/frida-server &"
```

##### Using Frida on Android

With frida-server running, you should now be able to get a list of running processes with the following command (use the `-U` option to indicate Frida to use a connected USB devices or emulator):

```bash
$ frida-ps -U
  PID  Name
-----  --------------------------------------------------------------
  276  adbd
  956  android.process.media
  198  bridgemgrd
30692  com.android.chrome
30774  com.android.chrome:privileged_process0
30747  com.android.chrome:sandboxed
30834  com.android.chrome:sandboxed
 3059  com.android.nfc
 1526  com.android.phone
17104  com.android.settings
 1302  com.android.systemui
(...)
```

Or restrict the list with the `-Uai` flag combination to get all apps (`-a`) currently installed (`-i`) on the connected USB device (`-U`):

```bash
$ frida-ps -Uai
  PID  Name                                      Identifier
-----  ----------------------------------------  ------------------------------
  766  Android System                            android
30692  Chrome                                    com.android.chrome
 3520  Contacts Storage                          com.android.providers.contacts
    -  Uncrackable1                              sg.vantagepoint.uncrackable1
    -  drozer Agent                              com.mwr.dz
```

This will show the names and identifiers of all apps, if they are currently running it will also show their PIDs. Search for your app in the list and take a note of the PID or its name/identifier. From now on you'll refer to your app by using one of them. A recommendation is to use the identifiers, as the PIDs will change on each run of the app. For example let's take `com.android.chrome`. You can use this string now on all Frida tools, e.g. on the Frida CLI, on frida-trace or from a Python script.

##### Tracing Native Libraries with frida-trace

To trace specific (low-level) library calls, you can use the `frida-trace` command line tool:

```bash
frida-trace -U com.android.chrome -i "open"
```

This generates a little JavaScript in `__handlers__/libc.so/open.js`, which Frida injects into the process. The script traces all calls to the `open` function in `libc.so`. You can modify the generated script according to your needs with Frida [JavaScript API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/).

Unfortunately tracing high-level methods of Java classes is not yet supported (but might be [in the future](https://github.com/frida/frida-python/issues/70 "Support for tracing high-level methods of Java Classes via patterns")).

##### Frida CLI and the Java API

Use the Frida CLI tool (`frida`) to work with Frida interactively. It hooks into a process and gives you a command line interface to Frida's API.

```bash
frida -U com.android.chrome
```

With the `-l` option, you can also use the Frida CLI to load scripts , e.g., to load `myscript.js`:

```bash
frida -U -l myscript.js com.android.chrome
```

Frida also provides a [Java API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#java "Frida - Java API"), which is especially helpful for dealing with Android apps. It lets you work with Java classes and objects directly. Here is a script to overwrite the `onResume` function of an Activity class:

```java
Java.perform(function () {
    var Activity = Java.use("android.app.Activity");
    Activity.onResume.implementation = function () {
        console.log("[*] onResume() got called!");
        this.onResume();
    };
});
```

The above script calls `Java.perform` to make sure that your code gets executed in the context of the Java VM. It instantiates a wrapper for the `android.app.Activity` class via `Java.use` and overwrites the `onResume` function. The new `onResume` function implementation prints a notice to the console and calls the original `onResume` method by invoking `this.onResume` every time an activity is resumed in the app.

The [JADX decompiler](#jadx) (v1.3.3 and above) can generate Frida snippets through its graphical code browser. To use this feature, open the APK or DEX with `jadx-gui`, browse to the target method, right click the method name, and select "Copy as frida snippet (f)". For example using the MASTG [UnCrackable App for Android Level 1](0x08b-Reference-Apps.md#android-uncrackable-l1):

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x08a/jadx_copy_frida_snippet.png" width="100%" />

The above steps place the following output in the pasteboard, which you can then paste in a JavaScript file and feed into `frida -U -l`.

```javascript
let a = Java.use("sg.vantagepoint.a.a");
a["a"].implementation = function (bArr, bArr2) {
    console.log('a is called' + ', ' + 'bArr: ' + bArr + ', ' + 'bArr2: ' + bArr2);
    let ret = this.a(bArr, bArr2);
    console.log('a ret value is ' + ret);
    return ret;
};
```

The above code hooks the `a` method within the `sg.vantagepoint.a.a` class and logs its input parameters and return values.

Frida also lets you search for and work with instantiated objects that are on the heap. The following script searches for instances of `android.view.View` objects and calls their `toString` method. The result is printed to the console:

```java
setImmediate(function() {
    console.log("[*] Starting script");
    Java.perform(function () {
        Java.choose("android.view.View", {
             "onMatch":function(instance){
                  console.log("[*] Instance found: " + instance.toString());
             },
             "onComplete":function() {
                  console.log("[*] Finished heap search")
             }
        });
    });
});
```

The output would look like this:

```bash
[*] Starting script
[*] Instance found: android.view.View{7ccea78 G.ED..... ......ID 0,0-0,0 #7f0c01fc app:id/action_bar_black_background}
[*] Instance found: android.view.View{2809551 V.ED..... ........ 0,1731-0,1731 #7f0c01ff app:id/menu_anchor_stub}
[*] Instance found: android.view.View{be471b6 G.ED..... ......I. 0,0-0,0 #7f0c01f5 app:id/location_bar_verbose_status_separator}
[*] Instance found: android.view.View{3ae0eb7 V.ED..... ........ 0,0-1080,63 #102002f android:id/statusBarBackground}
[*] Finished heap search
```

You can also use Java's reflection capabilities. To list the public methods of the `android.view.View` class, you could create a wrapper for this class in Frida and call `getMethods` from the wrapper's `class` property:

```java
Java.perform(function () {
    var view = Java.use("android.view.View");
    var methods = view.class.getMethods();
    for(var i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) {
        console.log(methods[i].toString());
    }
});
```

This will print a very long list of methods to the terminal:

```java
public boolean android.view.View.canResolveLayoutDirection()
public boolean android.view.View.canResolveTextAlignment()
public boolean android.view.View.canResolveTextDirection()
public boolean android.view.View.canScrollHorizontally(int)
public boolean android.view.View.canScrollVertically(int)
public final void android.view.View.cancelDragAndDrop()
public void android.view.View.cancelLongPress()
public final void android.view.View.cancelPendingInputEvents()
...
```

#### Frida for iOS

Frida supports interaction with the Objective-C runtime through the [ObjC API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#objc "Frida - ObjC API"). You'll be able to hook and call both Objective-C and native functions inside the process and its native libraries. Your JavaScript snippets have full access to memory, e.g. to read and/or write any structured data.

Here are some tasks that Frida APIs offers and are relevant or exclusive on iOS:

- Instantiate Objective-C objects and call static and non-static class methods ([ObjC API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#objc "Frida - ObjC API")).
- Trace Objective-C method calls and/or replace their implementations ([Interceptor API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#interceptor "Frida - Interceptor API")).
- Enumerate live instances of specific classes by scanning the heap ([ObjC API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#objc "Frida - ObjC API")).
- Scan process memory for occurrences of a string ([Memory API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#memory "Frida - Memory API")).
- Intercept native function calls to run your own code at function entry and exit ([Interceptor API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#interceptor "Frida - Interceptor API")).

Remember that on iOS, you can also benefit from the built-in tools provided when installing Frida, which include the Frida CLI (`frida`), `frida-ps`, `frida-ls-devices` and `frida-trace`, to name a few.

There's a `frida-trace` feature exclusive on iOS worth highlighting: tracing Objective-C APIs using the `-m` flag and wildcards. For example, tracing all methods including "HTTP" in their name and belonging to any class whose name starts with "NSURL" is as easy as running:

```bash
frida-trace -U YourApp -m "*[NSURL* *HTTP*]"
```

For a quick start you can go through the [iOS examples](https://www.frida.re/docs/examples/ios/ "Frida iOS examples").

##### Installing Frida on iOS

To connect Frida to an iOS app, you need a way to inject the Frida runtime into that app. This is easy to do on a jailbroken device: just install `frida-server` through Cydia. Once it has been installed, the Frida server will automatically run with root privileges, allowing you to easily inject code into any process.

Start Cydia and add Frida's repository by navigating to **Manage** -> **Sources** -> **Edit** -> **Add** and entering <https://build.frida.re>. You should then be able to find and install the Frida package.

##### Using Frida on iOS

Connect your device via USB and make sure that Frida works by running the `frida-ps` command and the flag '-U'. This should return the list of processes running on the device:

```bash
$ frida-ps -U
PID  Name
---  ----------------
963  Mail
952  Safari
416  BTServer
422  BlueTool
791  CalendarWidget
451  CloudKeychainPro
239  CommCenter
764  ContactsCoreSpot
(...)
```

#### Frida Bindings

In order to extend the scripting experience, Frida offers bindings to programming languages such as Python, C, NodeJS, and Swift.

Taking Python as an example, the first thing to note is that no further installation steps are required. Start your Python script with `import frida` and you're ready to go. See the following script that simply runs the previous JavaScript snippet:

```python
# frida_python.py
import frida

session = frida.get_usb_device().attach('com.android.chrome')

source = """
Java.perform(function () {
    var view = Java.use("android.view.View");
    var methods = view.class.getMethods();
    for(var i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) {
        console.log(methods[i].toString());
    }
});
"""

script = session.create_script(source)
script.load()

session.detach()
```

In this case, running the Python script (`python3 frida_python.py`) has the same result as the previous example: it will print all methods of the `android.view.View` class to the terminal. However, you might want to work with that data from Python. Using `send` instead of `console.log` will send data in JSON format from JavaScript to Python. Please read the comments in the example below:

```python
# python3 frida_python_send.py
import frida

session = frida.get_usb_device().attach('com.android.chrome')

# 1. we want to store method names inside a list
android_view_methods = []

source = """
Java.perform(function () {
    var view = Java.use("android.view.View");
    var methods = view.class.getMethods();
    for(var i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) {
        send(methods[i].toString());
    }
});
"""

script = session.create_script(source)

# 2. this is a callback function, only method names containing "Text" will be appended to the list
def on_message(message, data):
    if "Text" in message['payload']:
        android_view_methods.append(message['payload'])

# 3. we tell the script to run our callback each time a message is received
script.on('message', on_message)

script.load()

# 4. we do something with the collected data, in this case we just print it
for method in android_view_methods:
    print(method)

session.detach()
```

This effectively filters the methods and prints only the ones containing the string "Text":

```java
$ python3 frida_python_send.py
public boolean android.view.View.canResolveTextAlignment()
public boolean android.view.View.canResolveTextDirection()
public void android.view.View.setTextAlignment(int)
public void android.view.View.setTextDirection(int)
public void android.view.View.setTooltipText(java.lang.CharSequence)
...
```

In the end, it is up to you to decide where would you like to work with the data. Sometimes it will be more convenient to do it from JavaScript and in other cases Python will be the best choice. Of course you can also send messages from Python to JavaScript by using `script.post`. Refer to the Frida docs for more information about [sending](https://www.frida.re/docs/messages/#sending-messages-from-a-target-process "Sending messages from a target process") and [receiving](https://www.frida.re/docs/messages/#receiving-messages-in-a-target-process "Receiving messages in a target process") messages.

### Frida CodeShare

[Frida CodeShare](https://codeshare.frida.re/ "Frida CodeShare") is a repository containing a collection of ready-to-run Frida scripts which can enormously help when performing concrete tasks both on Android as on iOS as well as also serve as inspiration to build your own scripts. Two representative examples are:

### Ghidra

Ghidra is an open source software reverse engineering (SRE) suite of tools developed by the United State of America's National Security Agency's (NSA) Research Directorate. Ghidra is a versatile tool which comprises of a disassembler, decompiler and a built-in scripting engine for advanced usage. Please refer to the [installation guide](https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html "Ghidra Installation Guide") on how to install it and also look at the [cheat sheet](https://ghidra-sre.org/CheatSheet.html "Cheat Sheet") for a first overview of available commands and shortcuts. In this section, we will have walk-through on how to create a project, view disassembly and decompiled code for a binary.

Start Ghidra using `ghidraRun` (\*nix) or `ghidraRun.bat` (Windows), depending on the platform you are on. Once Ghidra is fired up, create a new project by specifying the project directory. You will be greeted by a window as shown below:

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x04c/Ghidra_new_project.png" width="100%" />

In your new **Active Project** you can import an app binary by going to **File** -> **Import File** and choosing the desired file.

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x04c/Ghidra_import_binary.png" width="100%" />

If the file can be properly processed, Ghidra will show meta-information about the binary before starting the analysis.

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x04c/Ghidra_elf_import.png" width="100%" />

To get the disassembled code for the binary file chosen above, double click the imported file from the **Active Project** window. Click **yes** and **analyze** for auto-analysis on the subsequent windows. Auto-analysis will take some time depending on the size of the binary, the progress can be tracked in the bottom right corner of the code browser window. Once auto-analysis is completed you can start exploring the binary.

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x04c/Ghidra_main_window.png" width="100%" />

The most important windows to explore a binary in Ghidra are the **Listing** (Disassembly) window, the **Symbol Tree** window and the **Decompiler** window, which shows the decompiled version of the function selected for disassembly. The **Display Function Graph** option shows control flow graph of the selected function.

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x04c/Ghidra_function_graph.png" width="100%" />

There are many other functionalities available in Ghidra and most of them can be explored by opening the **Window** menu. For example, if you want to examine the strings present in the binary, open the **Defined Strings** option. We will discuss other advanced functionalities while analyzing various binaries for Android and iOS platforms in the coming chapters.

### IDA Pro (Commercial Tool)

A Windows, Linux or macOS hosted multi-processor disassembler and debugger - <https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml>

### LIEF

The purpose of LIEF is to provide a cross platform library to parse, modify and abstract ELF, PE and MachO formats. With it you can, for instance, inject a certain library as a dependency of a native library, which an application already loads by default. - <https://lief.quarkslab.com/>

### MobSF

[MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF "MobSF") (Mobile Security Framework) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application pentesting framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. The easiest way of getting MobSF started is via Docker.

```bash
docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```

Or install and start it locally on your host computer by running:

```bash
# Setup
git clone https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git
cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
./setup.sh # For Linux and Mac
setup.bat # For Windows

# Installation process
./run.sh # For Linux and Mac
run.bat # For Windows
```

Once you have MobSF up and running you can open it in your browser by navigating to <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. Simply drag the APK you want to analyze into the upload area and MobSF will start its job.

#### MobSF for Android

After MobSF is done with its analysis, you will receive a one-page overview of all the tests that were executed. The page is split up into multiple sections giving some first hints on the attack surface of the application.

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x05b/mobsf_android.png" width="100%" />

The following is displayed:

- Basic information about the app and its binary file.
- Some options to:
  - View the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
  - View the IPC components of the app.
- Signer certificate.
- App permissions.
- A security analysis showing known defects e.g. if the app backups are enabled.
- List of libraries used by the app binary and list of all files inside the unzipped APK.
- Malware analysis that checks for malicious URLs.

Refer to [MobSF documentation](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/1.-Documentation "MobSF documentation") for more details.

#### MobSF for iOS

By running MobSF locally on a macOS host you'll benefit from a slightly better class-dump output.

Once you have MobSF up and running you can open it in your browser by navigating to <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. Simply drag the IPA you want to analyze into the upload area and MobSF will start its job.

After MobSF is done with its analysis, you will receive a one-page overview of all the tests that were executed. The page is split up into multiple sections giving some first hints on the attack surface of the application.

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x06b/mobsf_ios.png" width="100%" />

The following is displayed:

- Basic information about the app and its binary file.
- Some options to:
  - View the `Info.plist` file.
  - View the strings contained in the app binary.
  - Download a class-dump, if the app was written in Objective-C; if it is written in Swift no class-dump can be created.
- List all Purpose Strings extracted from the `Info.plist` which give some hints on the app's permissions.
- Exceptions in the App Transport Security (ATS) configuration will be listed.
- A brief binary analysis showing if free binary security features are activated or e.g. if the binary makes use of banned APIs.
- List of libraries used by the app binary and list of all files inside the unzipped IPA.

> In contrast to the Android use case, MobSF does not offer any dynamic analysis features for iOS apps.

Refer to [MobSF documentation](https://mobsf.github.io/docs "MobSF documentation") for more details.

### nm

nm is a tool that displays the name list (symbol table) of the given binary. You can find more information for the [Android (GNU)](<https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/binutils-2.12/html_node/binutils_4.html> "nm -binutils") version and [for iOS](http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/nm/osx-10.12.6.php "nm").

### Objection

[Objection](https://github.com/sensepost/objection "Objection on GitHub") is a "runtime mobile exploration toolkit, powered by Frida". Its main goal is to allow security testing on non-rooted devices through an intuitive interface.

Objection achieves this goal by providing you with the tools to easily inject the Frida gadget into an application by repackaging it. This way, you can deploy the repackaged app to the non-rooted/non-jailbroken device by sideloading it. Objection also provides a REPL that allows you to interact with the application, giving you the ability to perform any action that the application can perform.

Objection can be installed through pip as described on [Objection's Wiki](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Installation "Objection Wiki - Installation").

```bash
pip3 install objection
```

#### Objection for Android

Objection offers several features specific to Android. You can find the [full list of features](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Features) on the project's page, but here are a few interesting ones:

- Repackage applications to include the Frida gadget
- Disable SSL pinning for popular methods
- Access application storage to download or upload files
- Execute custom Frida scripts
- List the Activities, Services and Broadcast receivers
- Start Activities

If you have a rooted device with frida-server installed, Objection can connect directly to the running Frida server to provide all its functionality without needing to repackage the application. However, it is not always possible to root an Android device or the app may contain advanced RASP controls for root detection, so injecting a frida-gadget may be the easiest way to bypass those controls.

The ability to **perform advanced dynamic analysis on non-rooted devices** is one of the features that makes Objection incredibly useful. After following the [repackaging process](0x05b-Basic-Security_Testing.md#repackaging-apps) you will be able to run all the aforementioned commands which make it very easy to quickly analyze an application, or bypass basic security controls.

##### Using Objection on Android

Starting up Objection depends on whether you've patched the APK or whether you are using a rooted device running Frida-server. For running a patched APK, objection will automatically find any attached devices and search for a listening Frida gadget. However, when using frida-server, you need to explicitly tell frida-server which application you want to analyze.

```bash
# Connecting to a patched APK
objection explore

# Find the correct name using frida-ps
$ frida-ps -Ua | grep -i telegram
30268  Telegram                               org.telegram.messenger

# Connecting to the Telegram app through Frida-server
$ objection --gadget="org.telegram.messenger" explore
```

Once you are in the Objection REPL, you can execute any of the available commands. Below is an overview of some of the most useful ones:

```bash
# Show the different storage locations belonging to the app
$ env

# Disable popular ssl pinning methods
$ android sslpinning disable

# List items in the keystore
$ android keystore list

# Try to circumvent root detection
$ android root disable

```

More information on using the Objection REPL can be found on the [Objection Wiki](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Using-objection "Using Objection")

#### Objection for iOS

Objection offers several features specific to iOS. You can find the [full list of features](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Features) on the project's page, but here are a few interesting ones:

- Repackage applications to include the Frida gadget
- Disable SSL pinning for popular methods
- Access application storage to download or upload files
- Execute custom Frida scripts
- Dump the Keychain
- Read plist files

All these tasks and more can be easily done by using the commands in objection's REPL. For example, you can obtain the classes used in an app, functions of classes or information about the bundles of an app by running:

```bash
OWASP.iGoat-Swift on (iPhone: 12.0) [usb] # ios hooking list classes
OWASP.iGoat-Swift on (iPhone: 12.0) [usb] # ios hooking list class_methods <ClassName>
OWASP.iGoat-Swift on (iPhone: 12.0) [usb] # ios bundles list_bundles
```

If you have a jailbroken device with frida-server installed, Objection can connect directly to the running Frida server to provide all its functionality without needing to repackage the application. However, it is not always possible to jailbreak the latest version of iOS, or you may have an application with advanced jailbreak detection mechanisms.

The ability to **perform advanced dynamic analysis on non-jailbroken devices** is one of the features that makes Objection incredibly useful. After following the [repackaging process](0x06b-Basic-Security-Testing.md#repackaging-apps) you will be able to run all the aforementioned commands which make it very easy to quickly analyze an application, or get around basic security controls.

##### Using Objection on iOS

Starting up Objection depends on whether you've patched the IPA or whether you are using a jailbroken device running Frida-server. For running a patched IPA, objection will automatically find any attached devices and search for a listening Frida gadget. However, when using frida-server, you need to explicitly tell frida-server which application you want to analyze.

```bash
# Connecting to a patched IPA
$ objection explore

# Using frida-ps to get the correct application name
$ frida-ps -Ua | grep -i Telegram
983  Telegram

# Connecting to the Telegram app through Frida-server
$ objection --gadget="Telegram" explore
```

Once you are in the Objection REPL, you can execute any of the available commands. Below is an overview of some of the most useful ones:

```bash
# Show the different storage locations belonging to the app
$ env

# Disable popular ssl pinning methods
$ ios sslpinning disable

# Dump the Keychain
$ ios keychain dump

# Dump the Keychain, including access modifiers. The result will be written to the host in myfile.json
$ ios keychain dump --json <myfile.json>

# Show the content of a plist file
$ ios plist cat <myfile.plist>

```

More information on using the Objection REPL can be found on the [Objection Wiki](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Using-objection "Using Objection")

### r2frida

[r2frida](https://github.com/nowsecure/r2frida "r2frida on Github") is a project that allows radare2 to connect to Frida, effectively merging the powerful reverse engineering capabilities of radare2 with the dynamic instrumentation toolkit of Frida. r2frida can be used in both on Android and iOS, allowing you to:

- Attach radare2 to any local process or remote frida-server via USB or TCP.
- Read/Write memory from the target process.
- Load Frida information such as maps, symbols, imports, classes and methods into radare2.
- Call r2 commands from Frida as it exposes the r2pipe interface into the Frida Javascript API.

Please refer to [r2frida's official installation instructions](https://github.com/nowsecure/r2frida/blob/master/README.md#installation "r2frida installation instructions").

With frida-server running, you should now be able to attach to it using the pid, spawn path, host and port, or device-id. For example, to attach to PID 1234:

```bash
r2 frida://1234
```

For more examples on how to connect to frida-server, [see the usage section in the r2frida's README page](https://github.com/nowsecure/r2frida/blob/master/README.md#usage "r2frida usage").

> The following examples were executed using an Android app but also apply to iOS apps.

Once in the r2frida session, all commands start with `\` or `=!`. For example, in radare2 you'd run `i` to display the binary information, but in r2frida you'd use `\i`.

> See all options with `r2 frida://?`.

```bash
[0x00000000]> \i
arch                x86
bits                64
os                  linux
pid                 2218
uid                 1000
objc                false
runtime             V8
java                false
cylang              false
pageSize            4096
pointerSize         8
codeSigningPolicy   optional
isDebuggerAttached  false
```

To search in memory for a specific keyword, you may use the search command `\/`:

```bash
[0x00000000]> \/ unacceptable
Searching 12 bytes: 75 6e 61 63 63 65 70 74 61 62 6c 65
Searching 12 bytes in [0x0000561f05ebf000-0x0000561f05eca000]
...
Searching 12 bytes in [0xffffffffff600000-0xffffffffff601000]
hits: 23
0x561f072d89ee hit12_0 unacceptable policyunsupported md algorithmvar bad valuec
0x561f0732a91a hit12_1 unacceptableSearching 12 bytes: 75 6e 61 63 63 65 70 74 61
```

To output the search results in JSON format, we simply add `j` to our previous search command (just as we do in the r2 shell). This can be used in most of the commands:

```bash
[0x00000000]> \/j unacceptable
Searching 12 bytes: 75 6e 61 63 63 65 70 74 61 62 6c 65
Searching 12 bytes in [0x0000561f05ebf000-0x0000561f05eca000]
...
Searching 12 bytes in [0xffffffffff600000-0xffffffffff601000]
hits: 23
{"address":"0x561f072c4223","size":12,"flag":"hit14_1","content":"unacceptable \
policyunsupported md algorithmvar bad valuec0"},{"address":"0x561f072c4275", \
"size":12,"flag":"hit14_2","content":"unacceptableSearching 12 bytes: 75 6e 61 \
63 63 65 70 74 61"},{"address":"0x561f072c42c8","size":12,"flag":"hit14_3", \
"content":"unacceptableSearching 12 bytes: 75 6e 61 63 63 65 70 74 61 "},
...
```

To list the loaded libraries use the command `\il` and filter the results using the internal grep from radare2 with the command `~`. For example, the following command will list the loaded libraries matching the keywords `keystore`, `ssl` and `crypto`:

```bash
[0x00000000]> \il~keystore,ssl,crypto
0x00007f3357b8e000 libssl.so.1.1
0x00007f3357716000 libcrypto.so.1.1
```

Similarly, to list the exports and filter the results by a specific keyword:

```bash
[0x00000000]> \iE libssl.so.1.1~CIPHER
0x7f3357bb7ef0 f SSL_CIPHER_get_bits
0x7f3357bb8260 f SSL_CIPHER_find
0x7f3357bb82c0 f SSL_CIPHER_get_digest_nid
0x7f3357bb8380 f SSL_CIPHER_is_aead
0x7f3357bb8270 f SSL_CIPHER_get_cipher_nid
0x7f3357bb7ed0 f SSL_CIPHER_get_name
0x7f3357bb8340 f SSL_CIPHER_get_auth_nid
0x7f3357bb7930 f SSL_CIPHER_description
0x7f3357bb8300 f SSL_CIPHER_get_kx_nid
0x7f3357bb7ea0 f SSL_CIPHER_get_version
0x7f3357bb7f10 f SSL_CIPHER_get_id
```

To list or set a breakpoint use the command db. This is useful when analyzing/modifying memory:

```bash
[0x00000000]> \db
```

Finally, remember that you can also run Frida JavaScript code with `\.` plus the name of the script:

```bash
[0x00000000]> \. agent.js
```

You can find more examples on [how to use r2frida](https://github.com/enovella/r2frida-wiki "Using r2frida") on their Wiki project.

### radare2

#### radare2 (Android)

[radare2](https://rada.re/r/ "Radare2 official website") (r2) is a popular open source reverse engineering framework for disassembling, debugging, patching and analyzing binaries that is scriptable and supports many architectures and file formats including Android and iOS apps. For Android, Dalvik DEX (odex, multidex), ELF (executables, .so, ART) and Java (JNI and Java classes) are supported. It also contains several useful scripts that can help you during mobile application analysis as it offers low level disassembling and safe static analysis that comes in handy when traditional tools fail.

radare2 implements a rich command line interface (CLI) where you can perform the mentioned tasks. However, if you're not really comfortable using the CLI for reverse engineering you may want to consider using the Web UI (via the `-H` flag) or the even more convenient Qt and C++ GUI version called [Cutter](https://github.com/radareorg/cutter "Cutter"). Do keep in mind that the CLI, and more concretely its Visual Mode and its scripting capabilities ([r2pipe](https://github.com/radare/radare2-r2pipe "r2pipe")), are the core of radare2's power and it's definitely worth learning how to use it.

##### Installing radare2

Please refer to [radare2's official installation instructions](https://github.com/radare/radare2/blob/master/README.md "radare2 installation instructions"). We highly recommend to always install radare2 from the GitHub version instead of via common package managers such as APT. Radare2 is in very active development, which means that third party repositories are often outdated.

##### Using radare2

The radare2 framework comprises a set of small utilities that can be used from the r2 shell or independently as CLI tools. These utilities include `rabin2`, `rasm2`, `rahash2`, `radiff2`, `rafind2`, `ragg2`, `rarun2`, `rax2`, and of course `r2`, which is the main one.

For example, you can use `rafind2` to read strings directly from an encoded Android Manifest (AndroidManifest.xml):

```bash
# Permissions
$ rafind2 -ZS permission AndroidManifest.xml
# Activities
$ rafind2 -ZS activity AndroidManifest.xml
# Content providers
$ rafind2 -ZS provider AndroidManifest.xml
# Services
$ rafind2 -ZS service AndroidManifest.xml
# Receivers
$ rafind2 -ZS receiver AndroidManifest.xml
```

Or use `rabin2` to get information about a binary file:

```bash
$ rabin2 -I UnCrackable-Level1/classes.dex
arch     dalvik
baddr    0x0
binsz    5528
bintype  class
bits     32
canary   false
retguard false
class    035
crypto   false
endian   little
havecode true
laddr    0x0
lang     dalvik
linenum  false
lsyms    false
machine  Dalvik VM
maxopsz  16
minopsz  1
nx       false
os       linux
pcalign  0
pic      false
relocs   false
sanitiz  false
static   true
stripped false
subsys   java
va       true
sha1  12-5508c  b7fafe72cb521450c4470043caa332da61d1bec7
adler32  12-5528c  00000000
```

Type `rabin2 -h` to see all options:

```bash
$ rabin2 -h
Usage: rabin2 [-AcdeEghHiIjlLMqrRsSUvVxzZ] [-@ at] [-a arch] [-b bits] [-B addr]
              [-C F:C:D] [-f str] [-m addr] [-n str] [-N m:M] [-P[-P] pdb]
              [-o str] [-O str] [-k query] [-D lang symname] file
 -@ [addr]       show section, symbol or import at addr
 -A              list sub-binaries and their arch-bits pairs
 -a [arch]       set arch (x86, arm, .. or <arch>_<bits>)
 -b [bits]       set bits (32, 64 ...)
 -B [addr]       override base address (pie bins)
 -c              list classes
 -cc             list classes in header format
 -H              header fields
 -i              imports (symbols imported from libraries)
 -I              binary info
 -j              output in json
 ...
```

Use the main `r2` utility to access the **r2 shell**. You can load DEX binaries just like any other binary:

```bash
r2 classes.dex
```

Enter `r2 -h` to see all available options. A very commonly used flag is `-A`, which triggers an analysis after loading the target binary. However, this should be used sparingly and with small binaries as it is very time and resource consuming. You can learn more about this in the chapter "[Tampering and Reverse Engineering on Android](0x05c-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering.md)".

Once in the r2 shell, you can also access functions offered by the other radare2 utilities. For example, running `i` will print the information of the binary, exactly as `rabin2 -I` does.

To print all the strings use `rabin2 -Z` or the command `iz` (or the less verbose `izq`) from the r2 shell.

```bash
[0x000009c8]> izq
0xc50 39 39 /dev/com.koushikdutta.superuser.daemon/
0xc79 25 25 /system/app/Superuser.apk
...
0xd23 44 44 5UJiFctbmgbDoLXmpL12mkno8HT4Lv8dlat8FxR2GOc=
0xd51 32 32 8d127684cbc37c17616d806cf50473cc
0xd76 6 6 <init>
0xd83 10 10 AES error:
0xd8f 20 20 AES/ECB/PKCS7Padding
0xda5 18 18 App is debuggable!
0xdc0 9 9 CodeCheck
0x11ac 7 7 Nope...
0x11bf 14 14 Root detected!
```

Most of the time you can append special options to your commands such as `q` to make the command less verbose (quiet) or `j` to give the output in JSON format (use `~{}` to prettify the JSON string).

```bash
[0x000009c8]> izj~{}
[
  {
    "vaddr": 3152,
    "paddr": 3152,
    "ordinal": 1,
    "size": 39,
    "length": 39,
    "section": "file",
    "type": "ascii",
    "string": "L2Rldi9jb20ua291c2hpa2R1dHRhLnN1cGVydXNlci5kYWVtb24v"
  },
  {
    "vaddr": 3193,
    "paddr": 3193,
    "ordinal": 2,
    "size": 25,
    "length": 25,
    "section": "file",
    "type": "ascii",
    "string": "L3N5c3RlbS9hcHAvU3VwZXJ1c2VyLmFwaw=="
  },
```

You can print the class names and their methods with the r2 command `ic` (_information classes_).

```bash
[0x000009c8]> ic

```

A common approach when inspecting a binary is to search for something, navigate to it and visualize it in order to interpret the code. One of the ways to find something using radare2 is by filtering the output of specific commands, i.e. to grep them using `~` plus a keyword (`~+` for case-insensitive). For example, we might know that the app is verifying something, we can inspect all radare2 flags and see where we find something related to "verify".

> When loading a file, radare2 tags everything it's able to find. These tagged names or references are called flags. You can access them via the command `f`.

In this case we will grep the flags using the keyword "verify":

```bash
[0x000009c8]> f~+verify
0x00000a38 132 sym.Lsg_vantagepoint_uncrackable1_MainActivity.method. \
verify_Landroid_view_View__V
0x00000a38 132 method.public.Lsg_vantagepoint_uncrackable1_MainActivity. \
Lsg_vantagepoint_uncrackable1
        _MainActivity.method.verify_Landroid_view_View__V
0x00001400 6 str.verify
```

It seems that we've found one method in 0x00000a38 (that was tagged two times) and one string in 0x00001400. Let's navigate (seek) to that method by using its flag:

```bash
[0x000009c8]> s sym.Lsg_vantagepoint_uncrackable1_MainActivity.method. \
verify_Landroid_view_View__V
```

And of course you can also use the disassembler capabilities of r2 and print the disassembly with the command `pd` (or `pdf` if you know you're already located in a function).

```bash
[0x00000a38]> pd
```

r2 commands normally accept options (see `pd?`), e.g. you can limit the opcodes displayed by appending a number ("N") to the command `pd N`.

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x05b/r2_pd_10.png" width="100%" />

Instead of just printing the disassembly to the console you may want to enter the so-called **Visual Mode** by typing `V`.

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x05b/r2_visualmode_hex.png" width="100%" />

By default, you will see the hexadecimal view. By typing `p` you can switch to different views, such as the disassembly view:

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x05b/r2_visualmode_disass.png" width="100%" />

Radare2 offers a **Graph Mode** that is very useful to follow the flow of the code. You can access it from the Visual Mode by typing `V`:

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x05b/r2_graphmode.png" width="100%" />

This is only a selection of some radare2 commands to start getting some basic information from Android binaries. Radare2 is very powerful and has dozens of commands that you can find on the [radare2 command documentation](https://book.rada.re/basic_commands/intro.html "radare2 command documentation"). Radare2 will be used throughout the guide for different purposes such as reversing code, debugging or performing binary analysis. We will also use it in combination with other frameworks, especially Frida (see the r2frida section for more information).

Please refer to the chapter "[Tampering and Reverse Engineering on Android](0x05c-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering.md)" for more detailed use of radare2 on Android, especially when analyzing native libraries. You may also want to read the [official radare2 book](https://book.rada.re/ "Radare2 book").

#### Radare2 (iOS)

[Radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2 "Radare2") is a complete framework for reverse-engineering and analyzing binaries. The installation instructions can be found in the GitHub repository. To learn more on radare2 you may want to read the [official radare2 book](https://book.rada.re/ "Radare2 book").

### RMS Runtime Mobile Security

[RMS - Runtime Mobile Security](https://github.com/m0bilesecurity/RMS-Runtime-Mobile-Security "Runtime Mobile Security (RMS)") is a runtime mobile application analysis toolkit, supporting Android and iOS Apps. It offers a web GUI and is written in Python.

It's leveraging a running Frida server on a jailbroken device with the following out-of-box functionalities:

- Execute popular Frida scripts
- Execute custom Frida scripts
- Dump all the loaded classes and relative methods
- Hook methods on the fly
- (Android) Monitor Android APIs and usage of native APIs

The installation instructions and "how-to guide" of RMS can be found in the [Readme of the Github repo](https://github.com/m0bilesecurity/RMS-Runtime-Mobile-Security "Github Repo of RMS").

## Tools for Android

### Adb

[adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb "Android Debug Bridge") (Android Debug Bridge), shipped with the Android SDK, bridges the gap between your local development environment and a connected Android device. You'll usually leverage it to test apps on the emulator or a connected device via USB or Wi-Fi. Use the `adb devices` command to list the connected devices and execute it with the `-l` argument to retrieve more details on them.

```bash
$ adb devices -l
List of devices attached
090c285c0b97f748 device usb:1-1 product:razor model:Nexus_7 device:flo
emulator-5554    device product:sdk_google_phone_x86 model:Android_SDK_built_for_x86 device:generic_x86 transport_id:1
```

adb provides other useful commands such as `adb shell` to start an interactive shell on a target and `adb forward` to forward traffic on a specific host port to a different port on a connect device.

```bash
adb forward tcp:<host port> tcp:<device port>
```

```bash
$ adb -s emulator-5554 shell
root@generic_x86:/ # ls
acct
cache
charger
config
...
```

You'll come across different use cases on how you can use adb commands when testing later in this book. Note that you must define the serialnummer of the target device with the `-s` argument (as shown by the previous code snippet) in case you have multiple devices connected.

### Android NDK

The Android NDK contains prebuilt versions of the native compiler and toolchain. Both the GCC and Clang compilers have traditionally been supported, but active support for GCC ended with NDK revision 14. The device architecture and host OS determine the appropriate version. The prebuilt toolchains are in the `toolchains` directory of the NDK, which contains one subdirectory for each architecture.

|Architecture | Toolchain name|
|------------ | --------------|
|ARM-based|arm-linux-androideabi-&lt;gcc-version&gt;|
|x86-based|x86-&lt;gcc-version&gt;|
|MIPS-based|mipsel-linux-android-&lt;gcc-version&gt;|
|ARM64-based|aarch64-linux-android-&lt;gcc-version&gt;|
|X86-64-based|x86_64-&lt;gcc-version&gt;|
|MIPS64-based|mips64el-linux-android-&lt;gcc-version&gt;|

Besides picking the right architecture, you need to specify the correct sysroot for the native API level you want to target. The sysroot is a directory that contains the system headers and libraries for your target. Native APIs vary by Android API level. Available sysroot directories for each Android API level can be found in `$NDK/platforms/`. Each API level directory contains subdirectories for the various CPUs and architectures.

One possibility for setting up the build system is exporting the compiler path and necessary flags as environment variables. To make things easier, however, the NDK allows you to create a so-called standalone toolchain, which is a temporary toolchain that incorporates the required settings.

To set up a standalone toolchain, download the [latest stable version of the NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html#stable-downloads "Android NDK Downloads"). Extract the ZIP file, change into the NDK root directory, and run the following command:

```bash
./build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --arch arm --api 24 --install-dir /tmp/android-7-toolchain
```

This creates a standalone toolchain for Android 7.0 (API level 24) in the directory `/tmp/android-7-toolchain`. For convenience, you can export an environment variable that points to your toolchain directory, (we'll be using this in the examples). Run the following command or add it to your `.bash_profile` or other startup script:

```bash
export TOOLCHAIN=/tmp/android-7-toolchain
```

### Android SDK

Local Android SDK installations are managed via Android Studio. Create an empty project in Android Studio and select **Tools** -> **SDK Manager** to open the SDK Manager GUI. The **SDK Platforms** tab is where you install SDKs for multiple API levels. Recent API levels are:

- Android 11.0 (API level 30)
- Android 10.0 (API level 29)
- Android 9.0 (API level 28)
- Android 8.1 (API level 27)
- Android 8.0 (API level 26)

An overview of all Android codenames, their version number and API levels can be found in the [Android Developer Documentation](https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers "Codenames, Tags, and Build Numbers").

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x05c/sdk_manager.jpg" width="100%" />

Installed SDKs are on the following paths:

Windows:

```bash
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk
```

MacOS:

```bash
/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk
```

Note: On Linux, you need to choose an SDK directory. `/opt`, `/srv`, and `/usr/local` are common choices.

### Android Studio

The official IDE for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development - <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html>

### Android-SSL-TrustKiller

Android-SSL-TrustKiller is a Cydia Substrate Module acting as a blackbox tool to bypass SSL certificate pinning for most applications running on a device - <https://github.com/iSECPartners/Android-SSL-TrustKiller>

### APKiD

[APKiD](https://github.com/rednaga/APKiD) gives you information about how an APK was made. It identifies many compilers, packers, obfuscators, and other weird stuff.

For more information on what this tool can be used for, check out:

- [Android Compiler Fingerprinting](http://hitcon.org/2016/CMT/slide/day1-r0-e-1.pdf)

### APKLab

[APKLab](https://github.com/APKLab/APKLab "APKLab") is a convenient Visual Studio Code extension leveraging tools such as [apktool](#apktool) and [jadx](#jadx) to enable features including app unpacking, decompilation, code patching (e.g. for MITM), and repackaging straight from the IDE.

For more information, you can refer to [APKLab's official documentation](https://apklab.surendrajat.xyz/).

### Apktool

[Apktool](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool) is used to unpack Android app packages (APKs). Simply unzipping APKs with the standard `unzip` utility leaves some files unreadable. `AndroidManifest.xml` is encoded into binary XML format which isn’t readable with a text editor. Also, the app resources are still packaged into a single archive file.

When run with default command line flags, apktool automatically decodes the Android Manifest file to text-based XML format and extracts the file resources (it also disassembles the .DEX files to smali code - a feature that we’ll revisit later in this book).

Among the unpacked files you can usually find (after running `apktool d base.apk`):

- AndroidManifest.xml: The decoded Android Manifest file, which can be opened and edited in a text editor.
- apktool.yml: file containing information about the output of apktool
- original: folder containing the MANIFEST.MF file, which contains information about the files contained in the JAR file
- res: directory containing the app’s resources
- smali: directory containing the disassembled Dalvik bytecode.

You can also use apktool to repackage decoded resources back to binary APK/JAR. See the section "[Exploring the App Package](#exploring-the-app-package "Exploring the App Package")" later on this chapter and section "[Repackaging](0x05c-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering.md#repackaging "Repackaging")" in the chapter [Tampering and Reverse Engineering on Android](0x05c-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering.md) for more information and practical examples.

### apkx

apkx is a Python wrapper to popular free DEX converters and Java decompilers. It automates the extraction, conversion, and decompilation of APKs. Install it as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muellerberndt/apkx
cd apkx
sudo ./install.sh
```

This should copy apkx to `/usr/local/bin`. See section "[Decompiling Java Code](0x05c-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering.md#decompiling-java-code "Decompiling Java Code")" of the "Reverse Engineering and Tampering" chapter for more information about usage.

### Busybox

Busybox combines multiple common Unix utilities into a small single executable. The utilities included generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU counterparts, but are sufficient enough to provide a complete environment on a small or embedded system. Busybox can be installed on a rooted device by downloading the Busybox application from Google Play Store. You can also download the binary directly from the [Busybox website](https://busybox.net "Busybox Website"). Once downloaded, make an `adb push busybox /data/local/tmp` to have the executable available on your phone. A quick overview of how to install and use Busybox can be found in the [Busybox FAQ](https://busybox.net/FAQ.html#getting_started "Busybox FAQ").

### Bytecode Viewer

[Bytecode Viewer](https://bytecodeviewer.com/ "Bytecode Viewer") (BCV) is a free and open source Java decompiler framework running on all operating systems. It is a versatile tool which can be used to decompile Android apps, view APK resources (via apktool) and easily edit APKs (via Smali/Baksmali). Apart from APKs, also DEX, Java Class files and Java Jars can be viewed. One of its major features is the support for multiple Java bytecode decompilers under one GUI. BCV currently includes the Procyon, CFR, Fernflower, Krakatau, and JADX-Core decompilers. These decompilers have different strengths and can be easily leveraged while using BCV, especially when dealing with obfuscated programs.

### Drozer

[Drozer](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/drozer "Drozer on GitHub") is an Android security assessment framework that allows you to search for security vulnerabilities in apps and devices by assuming the role of a third-party app interacting with the other application's IPC endpoints and the underlying OS.

The advantage of using drozer consists on its ability to automate several tasks and that it can be expanded through modules. The modules are very helpful and they cover different categories including a scanner category that allows you to scan for known defects with a simple command such as the module `scanner.provider.injection` which detects SQL injections in content providers in all the apps installed in the system. Without drozer, simple tasks such as listing the app's permissions require several steps that include decompiling the APK and manually analyzing the results.

#### Installing Drozer

You can refer to [drozer GitHub page](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/drozer "Drozer on GitHub") (for Linux and Windows, for macOS please refer to this [blog post](https://fi5t.xyz/en/posts/drozer-on-mac/ "(not)Unique experience blog - Installing Drozer on macOS Catalina")) and the [drozer website](https://labs.withsecure.com/tools/drozer/ "Drozer Website") for prerequisites and installation instructions.

#### Using Drozer

Before you can start using drozer, you'll also need the drozer agent that runs on the Android device itself. Download the latest drozer agent [from the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/drozer/releases/ "drozer GitHub releases") and install it with `adb install drozer.apk`.

Once the setup is completed you can start a session to an emulator or a device connected per USB by running `adb forward tcp:31415 tcp:31415` and `drozer console connect`. This is called direct mode and you can see the full instructions in the [User Guide in section "Starting a Session"](https://labs.withsecure.com/assets/BlogFiles/mwri-drozer-user-guide-2015-03-23.pdf "Starting a Session"). An alternative is to run Drozer in infrastructure mode, where, you are running a drozer server that can handle multiple consoles and agents, and routes sessions between them. You can find the details of how to setup drozer in this mode in the ["Infrastructure Mode"](https://labs.withsecure.com/assets/BlogFiles/mwri-drozer-user-guide-2015-03-23.pdf "Infrastructure Mode") section of the User Guide.

Now you are ready to begin analyzing apps. A good first step is to enumerate the attack surface of an app which can be done easily with the following command:

```bash
dz> run app.package.attacksurface <package>
```

Again, without drozer this would have required several steps. The module `app.package.attacksurface` lists activities, broadcast receivers, content providers and services that are exported, hence, they are public and can be accessed through other apps. Once we have identified our attack surface, we can interact with the IPC endpoints through drozer without having to write a separate standalone app as it would be required for certain tasks such as communicating with a content provider.

For example, if the app has an exported Activity that leaks sensitive information we can invoke it with the Drozer module `app.activity.start`:

```bash
dz> run app.activity.start --component <package> <component name>
```

This previous command will start the activity, hopefully leaking some sensitive information. Drozer has modules for every type of IPC mechanism. Download [InsecureBankv2](0x08b-Reference-Apps.md#insecurebankv2) if you would like to try the modules with an intentionally vulnerable application that illustrates common problems related to IPC endpoints. Pay close attention to the modules in the scanner category as they are very helpful automatically detecting vulnerabilities even in system packages, specially if you are using a ROM provided by your cellphone company. Even [SQL injection vulnerabilities in system packages by Google](https://issuetracker.google.com/u/0/issues/36965126 "SQL injection in Android") have been identified in the past with drozer.

#### Other Drozer commands

Here's a non-exhaustive list of commands you can use to start exploring on Android:

```bash
# List all the installed packages
$ dz> run app.package.list

# Find the package name of a specific app
$ dz> run app.package.list -f (string to be searched)

# See basic information
$ dz> run app.package.info -a (package name)

# Identify the exported application components
$ dz> run app.package.attacksurface (package name)

# Identify the list of exported Activities
$ dz> run app.activity.info -a (package name)

# Launch the exported Activities
$ dz> run app.activity.start --component (package name) (component name)

# Identify the list of exported Broadcast receivers
$ dz> run app.broadcast.info -a (package name)

# Send a message to a Broadcast receiver
$ dz> run app.broadcast.send --action (broadcast receiver name) -- extra (number of arguments)

# Detect SQL injections in content providers
$ dz> run scanner.provider.injection -a (package name)
```

### Magisk

`Magisk` ("Magic Mask") is one way to root your Android device. It's specialty lies in the way the modifications on the system are performed. While other rooting tools alter the actual data on the system partition, Magisk does not (which is called "systemless"). This enables a way to hide the modifications from root-sensitive applications (e.g. for banking or games) and allows using the official Android OTA upgrades without the need to unroot the device beforehand.

You can get familiar with Magisk reading the official [documentation on GitHub](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/ "Magisk Documentation"). If you don't have Magisk installed, you can find installation instructions in [the documentation](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html "Magisk Installation"). If you use an official Android version and plan to upgrade it, Magisk provides a [tutorial on GitHub](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/ota.html "OTA Installation").

Learn more about [rooting your device with Magisk](#rooting-with-magisk "Rooting with Magisk").

### Proguard

[ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard "ProGuard") is a free Java class file shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier. It detects and removes unused classes, fields, methods, and attributes and can also be used to delete logging-related code.

### Termux

Termux is a terminal emulator for Android that provides a Linux environment that works directly with or without rooting and with no setup required. The installation of additional packages is a trivial task thanks to its own APT package manager (which makes a difference in comparison to other terminal emulator apps). You can search for specific packages by using the command `pkg search <pkg_name>` and install packages with `pkg install <pkg_name>`. You can install Termux straight from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux "Install Termux").

### Xposed

[Xposed](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/de.robv.android.xposed.installer/ "Xposed Installer") is a framework that allows to modify the system or application aspect and behavior at runtime, without modifying any Android application package (APK) or re-flashing. Technically, it is an extended version of Zygote that exports APIs for running Java code when a new process is started. Running Java code in the context of the newly instantiated app makes it possible to resolve, hook, and override Java methods belonging to the app. Xposed uses [reflection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/ "Reflection Tutorial") to examine and modify the running app. Changes are applied in memory and persist only during the process' runtime since the application binaries are not modified.

To use Xposed, you need to first install the Xposed framework on a rooted device as explained on [XDA-Developers Xposed framework hub](https://www.xda-developers.com/xposed-framework-hub/ "Xposed framework hub from XDA"). Modules can be installed through the Xposed Installer app, and they can be toggled on and off through the GUI.

Note: given that a plain installation of the Xposed framework is easily detected with SafetyNet, we recommend using Magisk to install Xposed. This way, applications with SafetyNet attestation should have a higher chance of being testable with Xposed modules.

Xposed has been compared to Frida. When you run Frida server on a rooted device, you will end up with a similarly effective setup. Both frameworks deliver a lot of value when you want to do dynamic instrumentation. When Frida crashes the app, you can try something similar with Xposed. Next, similar to the abundance of Frida scripts, you can easily use one of the many modules that come with Xposed, such as the earlier discussed module to bypass SSL pinning ([JustTrustMe](https://github.com/Fuzion24/JustTrustMe "JustTrustMe") and [SSLUnpinning](https://github.com/ac-pm/SSLUnpinning_Xposed "SSL Unpinning")). Xposed includes other modules, such as [Inspeckage](https://github.com/ac-pm/Inspeckage "Inspeckage") which allow you to do more in depth application testing as well. On top of that, you can create your own modules as well to patch often used security mechanisms of Android applications.

Xposed can also be installed on an emulator through the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Start your emulator with 'emulator -avd NAMEOFX86A8.0 -writable-system -selinux permissive -wipe-data'"
adb root && adb remount
adb install SuperSU\ v2.79.apk #binary can be downloaded from http://www.supersu.com/download
adb push root_avd-master/SuperSU/x86/su /system/xbin/su
adb shell chmod 0755 /system/xbin/su
adb shell setenforce 0

### Burp Suite Mobile Assistant

A tool to bypass certificate pinning and is able to inject into apps - <https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/mobile-assistant>

### class-dump

[class-dump by Steve Nygard](http://stevenygard.com/projects/class-dump/ "class-dump") is a command line utility for examining the Objective-C runtime information stored in Mach-O (Mach object) files. It generates declarations for the classes, categories, and protocols.

### class-dump-z

[class-dump-z](https://code.google.com/archive/p/networkpx/wikis/class_dump_z.wiki "class-dump-z") is class-dump re-written from scratch in C++, avoiding the use of dynamic calls. Removing these unnecessary calls makes class-dump-z nearly 10 times faster than its predecessor.

### class-dump-dyld

[class-dump-dyld by Elias Limneos](https://github.com/limneos/classdump-dyld/ "class-dump-dyld") allows symbols to be dumped and retrieved directly from the shared cache, eliminating the necessity of extracting the files first. It can generate header files from app binaries, libraries, frameworks, bundles, or the whole dyld_shared_cache. Directories or the entirety of dyld_shared_cache can be recursively mass-dumped.

### Clutch

Clutch decrypts iOS applications and dumps specified bundleID into binary or IPA file - <https://github.com/KJCracks/Clutch>

### Cyberduck

Libre FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, S3, Azure & OpenStack Swift browser for Mac and Windows - <https://cyberduck.io>

### Cycript

Cydia Substrate (formerly called MobileSubstrate) is the standard framework for developing Cydia runtime patches (the so-called "Cydia Substrate Extensions") on iOS. It comes with Cynject, a tool that provides code injection support for C.

Cycript is a scripting language developed by Jay Freeman (aka Saurik). It injects a JavaScriptCore VM into a running process. Via the Cycript interactive console, users can then manipulate the process with a hybrid Objective-C++ and JavaScript syntax. Accessing and instantiating Objective-C classes inside a running process is also possible.

In order to install Cycript, first download, unpack, and install the SDK.

```bash
#on iphone
$ wget https://cydia.saurik.com/api/latest/3 -O cycript.zip && unzip cycript.zip
$ sudo cp -a Cycript.lib/*.dylib /usr/lib
$ sudo cp -a Cycript.lib/cycript-apl /usr/bin/cycript
```

To spawn the interactive Cycript shell, run "./cycript" or "cycript" if Cycript is on your path.

```bash
$ cycript
cy#
```

To inject into a running process, we first need to find the process ID (PID). Run the application and make sure the app is in the foreground. Running `cycript -p <PID>` injects Cycript into the process. To illustrate, we will inject into SpringBoard (which is always running).

```bash
$ ps -ef | grep SpringBoard
501 78 1 0 0:00.00 ?? 0:10.57 /System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app/SpringBoard
$ ./cycript -p 78
cy#
```

One of the first things you can try out is to get the application instance (`UIApplication`), you can use Objective-C syntax:

```bash
cy# [UIApplication sharedApplication]
cy# var a = [UIApplication sharedApplication]
```

Use that variable now to get the application's delegate class:

```bash
cy# a.delegate
```

Let's try to trigger an alert message on SpringBoard with Cycript.

```bash
cy# alertView = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"OWASP MASTG" message:@"Mobile Application Security Testing Guide"  delegate:nil cancelButtonitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles:nil]
#"<UIAlertView: 0x1645c550; frame = (0 0; 0 0); layer = <CALayer: 0x164df160>>"
cy# [alertView show]
cy# [alertView release]
```

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x06c/cycript_sample.png" width="300px" />

Find the app's document directory with Cycript:

```bash
cy# [[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLsForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory inDomains:NSUserDomainMask][0]
#"file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/A8AE15EE-DC8B-4F1C-91A5-1FED35212DF/Documents/"
```

The command `[[UIApp keyWindow] recursiveDescription].toString()` returns the view hierarchy of `keyWindow`. The description of every subview and sub-subview of `keyWindow` is shown. The indentation space reflects the relationships between views. For example, `UILabel`, `UITextField`, and `UIButton` are subviews of `UIView`.

```xml
cy# [[UIApp keyWindow] recursiveDescription].toString()
`<UIWindow: 0x16e82190; frame = (0 0; 320 568); gestureRecognizers = <NSArray: 0x16e80ac0>; layer = <UIWindowLayer: 0x16e63ce0>>
  | <UIView: 0x16e935f0; frame = (0 0; 320 568); autoresize = W+H; layer = <CALayer: 0x16e93680>>
  |    | <UILabel: 0x16e8f840; frame = (0 40; 82 20.5); text = 'i am groot!'; hidden = YES; opaque = NO; autoresize = RM+BM; userInteractionEnabled = NO; layer = <_UILabelLayer: 0x16e8f920>>
  |    | <UILabel: 0x16e8e030; frame = (0 110.5; 320 20.5); text = 'A Secret Is Found In The ...'; opaque = NO; autoresize = RM+BM; userInteractionEnabled = NO; layer = <_UILabelLayer: 0x16e8e290>>
  |    | <UITextField: 0x16e8fbd0; frame = (8 141; 304 30); text = ''; clipsToBounds = YES; opaque = NO; autoresize = RM+BM; gestureRecognizers = <NSArray: 0x16e94550>; layer = <CALayer: 0x16e8fea0>>
  |    |    | <_UITextFieldRoundedRectBackgroundViewNeue: 0x16e92770; frame = (0 0; 304 30); opaque = NO; autoresize = W+H; userInteractionEnabled = NO; layer = <CALayer: 0x16e92990>>
  |    | <UIButton: 0x16d901e0; frame = (8 191; 304 30); opaque = NO; autoresize = RM+BM; layer = <CALayer: 0x16d90490>>
  |    |    | <UIButtonLabel: 0x16e72b70; frame = (133 6; 38 18); text = 'Verify'; opaque = NO; userInteractionEnabled = NO; layer = <_UILabelLayer: 0x16e974b0>>
  |    | <_UILayoutGuide: 0x16d92a00; frame = (0 0; 0 20); hidden = YES; layer = <CALayer: 0x16e936b0>>
  |    | <_UILayoutGuide: 0x16d92c10; frame = (0 568; 0 0); hidden = YES; layer = <CALayer: 0x16d92cb0>>`
```

You can also use Cycript's built-in functions such as `choose` which searches the heap for instances of the given Objective-C class:

```bash
cy# choose(SBIconModel)
[#"<SBIconModel: 0x1590c8430>"]
```

Learn more in the [Cycript Manual](http://www.cycript.org/manual/ "Cycript Manual").

### Cydia

Cydia is an alternative app store developed by Jay Freeman (aka "saurik") for jailbroken devices. It provides a graphical user interface and a version of the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT). You can easily access many "unsanctioned" app packages through Cydia. Most jailbreaks install Cydia automatically.

Many tools on a jailbroken device can be installed by using Cydia, which is the unofficial AppStore for iOS devices and allows you to manage repositories. In Cydia you should add (if not already done by default) the following repositories by navigating to **Sources** -> **Edit**, then clicking **Add** in the top left:

- <http://apt.thebigboss.org/repofiles/cydia/>: One of the most popular repositories is BigBoss, which contains various packages, such as the BigBoss Recommended Tools package.
- <https://cydia.akemi.ai/>: Add "Karen's Repo" to get the AppSync package.
- <https://build.frida.re>: Install Frida by adding the repository to Cydia.
- <https://repo.chariz.io>: Useful when managing your jailbreak on iOS 11.
- <https://apt.bingner.com/>: Another repository, with quiet a few good tools, is Elucubratus, which gets installed when you install Cydia on iOS 12 using Unc0ver.

> In case you are using the Sileo App Store, please keep in mind that the Sileo Compatibility Layer shares your sources between Cydia and Sileo, however, Cydia is unable to remove sources added in Sileo, and [Sileo is unable to remove sources added in Cydia](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/01/11/install-sileo-package-manager-on-unc0ver-jailbreak/ "You can now install the Sileo package manager on the unc0ver jailbreak"). Keep this in mind when you’re trying to remove sources.

After adding all the suggested repositories above you can install the following useful packages from Cydia to get started:

- adv-cmds: Advanced command line, which includes tools such as finger, fingerd, last, lsvfs, md, and ps.
- AppList: Allows developers to query the list of installed apps and provides a preference pane based on the list.
- Apt: Advanced Package Tool, which you can use to manage the installed packages similarly to DPKG, but in a more friendly way. This allows you to install, uninstall, upgrade, and downgrade packages from your Cydia repositories. Comes from Elucubratus.
- AppSync Unified: Allows you to sync and install unsigned iOS applications.
- BigBoss Recommended Tools: Installs many useful command line tools for security testing including standard Unix utilities that are missing from iOS, including wget, unrar, less, and sqlite3 client.
- class-dump: A command line tool for examining the Objective-C runtime information stored in Mach-O files and generating header files with class interfaces.
- class-dump-z: A command line tool for examining the Swift runtime information stored in Mach-O files and generating header files with class interfaces. This is not available via Cydia, therefore please refer to [installation steps](https://iosgods.com/topic/6706-how-to-install-class-dump-z-on-any-64bit-idevices-how-to-use-it/ "class-dump-z installation steps") in order to get class-dump-z running on your iOS device. Note that class-dump-z is not maintained and does not work well with Swift. It is recommended to use [dsdump](#dsdump "dsdump") instead.
- Clutch: Used to decrypt an app executable.
- Cycript: Is an inlining, optimizing, Cycript-to-JavaScript compiler and immediate-mode console environment that can be injected into running processes (associated to Substrate).
- Cydia Substrate: A platform that makes developing third-party iOS add-ons easier via dynamic app manipulation or introspection.
- cURL: Is a well known http client which you can use to download packages faster to your device. This can be a great help when you need to install different versions of Frida-server on your device for instance.
- Darwin CC Tools: A useful set of tools like nm, and strip that are capable of auditing mach-o files.
- IPA Installer Console: Tool for installing IPA application packages from the command line. After installing two commands will be available `installipa` and `ipainstaller` which are both the same.
- Frida: An app you can use for dynamic instrumentation. Please note that Frida has changed its implementation of its APIs over time, which means that some scripts might only work with specific versions of the Frida-server (which forces you to update/downgrade the version also on macOS). Running Frida Server installed via APT or Cydia is recommended. Upgrading/downgrading afterwards can be done, by following the instructions of [this Github issue](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump/issues/65#issuecomment-490790602 "Resolving Frida version").
- Grep: Handy tool to filter lines.
- Gzip: A well known ZIP utility.
- PreferenceLoader: A Substrate-based utility that allows developers to add entries to the Settings application, similar to the SettingsBundles that App Store apps use.
- SOcket CAT: a utility with which you can connect to sockets to read and write messages. This can come in handy if you want to trace the syslog on iOS 12 devices.

Besides Cydia there are several other open source tools available and should be installed, such as [Introspy](https://github.com/iSECPartners/Introspy-iOS "Introspy-iOS").

Besides Cydia you can also ssh into your iOS device and you can install the packages directly via apt-get, like for example adv-cmds.

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install adv-cmds
```

### dsdump

[dsdump](https://github.com/DerekSelander/dsdump "dsdump") is a tool to dump Objective-C classes and Swift type descriptors (classes, structs, enums). It only supports Swift version 5 or higher and does not support ARM 32-bit binaries.

The following example shows how you can dump Objective-C classes and Swift type descriptors of an iOS application.

First verify if the app's main binary is a FAT binary containing ARM64:

```bash
$ otool -hv [APP_MAIN_BINARY_FILE]
Mach header
      magic cputype cpusubtype  caps    filetype ncmds sizeofcmds      flags
   MH_MAGIC     ARM         V7  0x00     EXECUTE    39       5016   NOUNDEFS DYLDLINK TWOLEVEL PIE
Mach header
      magic cputype cpusubtype  caps    filetype ncmds sizeofcmds      flags
MH_MAGIC_64   ARM64        ALL  0x00     EXECUTE    38       5728   NOUNDEFS DYLDLINK TWOLEVEL PIE
```

If yes, then we specify the "--arch" parameter to "arm64", otherwise it is not needed if the binary only contains an ARM64 binary.

```bash
# Dump the Objective-C classes to a temporary file
$ dsdump --objc --color --verbose=5 --arch arm64 --defined [APP_MAIN_BINARY_FILE] > /tmp/OBJC.txt

# Dump the Swift type descriptors to a temporary file if the app is implemented in Swift
$ dsdump --swift --color --verbose=5 --arch arm64 --defined [APP_MAIN_BINARY_FILE] > /tmp/SWIFT.txt
```

You can find more information about the inner workings of dsdump and how to programmatically inspect a Mach-O binary to display the compiled Swift types and Objective-C classes in [this article](https://derekselander.github.io/dsdump/ "Building a class-dump in 2020").

### Frida-ios-dump

[Frida-ios-dump](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump "Frida-ios-dump") is a Python script that helps you retrieve the decrypted version of an iOS app (IPA) from an iOS device. It supports both Python 2 and Python 3 and requires Frida running on your iOS device (jailbroken or not). This tool uses Frida's [Memory API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#memory "Frida Memory API") to dump the memory of the running app and recreate an IPA file. Because the code is extracted from memory, it is automatically decrypted. Please refer to the section ["Using Frida-ios-dump"](#using-frida-ios-dump "Using Frida-ios-dump") for detailed instructions on how to use it.

```bash
$ npm install -g passionfruit
$ passionfruit
listening on http://localhost:31337
```

When you execute the command `passionfruit` a local server will be started on port 31337. Connect your jailbroken device with the Frida server running, or a non-jailbroken device with a repackaged app including Frida to your macOS device via USB. Once you click on the "iPhone" icon you will get an overview of all installed apps:

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x06b/Passionfruit.png" width="100%" />

With Passionfruit it's possible to explore different kinds of information concerning an iOS app. Once you selected the iOS app you can perform many tasks such as:

- Get information about the binary
- View folders and files used by the application and download them
- Inspect the Info.plist
- Get a UI Dump of the app screen shown on the iOS device
- List the modules that are loaded by the app
- Dump class names
- Dump keychain items
- Access to NSLog traces

### swift-demangle

swift-demangle is an Xcode tool that demangles Swift symbols. For more information run `xcrun swift-demangle -help` once installed.

### SwiftShield

[SwiftShield](https://github.com/rockbruno/swiftshield "SwiftShield") is a tool that generates irreversible, encrypted names for your iOS project's objects (including your Pods and Storyboards). This raises the bar for reverse engineers and will produce less helpful output when using reverse engineering tools such as class-dump and Frida.

> Warning: SwiftShield irreversibly overwrites all your source files. Ideally, you should have it run only on your CI server, and on release builds.

A sample Swift project is used to demonstrate the usage of SwiftShield.

- Check out [sushi2k/SwiftSecurity](https://github.com/sushi2k/SwiftSecurity).
- Open the project in Xcode and make sure that the project is building successfully (Product / Build or Apple-Key + B).
- [Download](https://github.com/rockbruno/swiftshield/releases "SwiftShield Download") the latest release of SwiftShield and unzip it.
- Go to the directory where you downloaded SwiftShield and copy the swiftshield executable to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
cp swiftshield/swiftshield /usr/local/bin/
```

- In your terminal go into the SwiftSecurity directory (which you checked out in step 1) and execute the command swiftshield (which you downloaded in step 3):

```bash
$ cd SwiftSecurity
$ swiftshield -automatic -project-root . -automatic-project-file SwiftSecurity.xcodeproj -automatic-project-scheme SwiftSecurity
SwiftShield 3.4.0
Automatic mode

...
```

SwiftShield is now detecting class and method names and is replacing their identifier with an encrypted value.

In the original source code you can see all the class and method identifiers:

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x06j/no_obfuscation.jpg" width="400px" />

SwiftShield was now replacing all of them with encrypted values that leave no trace to their original name or intention of the class/method:

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x06j/swiftshield_obfuscated.jpg" width="400px" />

After executing `swiftshield` a new directory will be created called `swiftshield-output`. In this directory another directory is created with a timestamp in the folder name. This directory contains a text file called `conversionMap.txt`, that maps the encrypted strings to their original values.

```bash
$ cat conversionMap.txt
//
// SwiftShield Conversion Map
// Automatic mode for SwiftSecurity, 2020-01-02 13.51.03
// Deobfuscate crash logs (or any text file) by running:
// swiftshield -deobfuscate CRASH_FILE -deobfuscate_map THIS_FILE

This is needed for [deobfuscating encrypted crash logs](https://github.com/rockbruno/swiftshield#-deobfuscating-encrypted-crash-logs "Deobfuscating encrypted Crash logs").

Another example project is available in SwiftShield's [Github repo](https://github.com/rockbruno/swiftshield/tree/master/ExampleProject "SwiftShieldExample"), that can be used to test the execution of SwiftShield.

### TablePlus

[TablePlus](https://tableplus.io/ "TablePlus") is a tool for Windows and macOS to inspect database files, like Sqlite and others. This can be very useful during iOS engagements when dumping the database files from the iOS device and analyzing the content of them with a GUI tool.

### Usbmuxd

[usbmuxd](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/usbmuxd "usbmuxd") is a socket daemon that monitors USB iPhone connections. You can use it to map the mobile device's localhost listening sockets to TCP ports on your host computer. This allows you to conveniently SSH into your iOS device without setting up an actual network connection. When usbmuxd detects an iPhone running in normal mode, it connects to the phone and begins relaying requests that it receives via `/var/run/usbmuxd`.

### Weak Classdump

A Cycript script that generates a header file for the class passed to the function. Most useful when classdump or dumpdecrypted cannot be used, when binaries are encrypted etc - <https://github.com/limneos/weak_classdump>

### Xcode

Xcode is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for macOS that contains a suite of tools for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. You can [download Xcode for free from the official Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/ "Apple Xcode IDE"). Xcode will offer you different tools and functions to interact with an iOS device that can be helpful during a penetration test, such as analyzing logs or sideloading of apps.

### Xcode Command Line Tools

After installing [Xcode](#xcode), in order to make all development tools available systemwide, it is recommended to install the Xcode Command Line Tools package. This will be handy during testing of iOS apps as some of the tools (e.g. objection) are also relying on the availability of this package. You can [download it from the official Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ "Apple iOS SDK") or install it straight away from your terminal:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### xcrun

[`xcrun`](http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/xcrun/ "xcrun man page") can be used invoke Xcode developer tools from the command-line, without having them in the path. For example you may want to use it to locate and run swift-demangle or simctl.

## Tools for Network Interception and Monitoring

### Android tcpdump

### bettercap

A powerful framework which aims to offer to security researchers and reverse engineers an easy to use, all-in-one solution for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy, wireless HID hijacking and Ethernet networks reconnaissance. It can be used during network penetration tests in order to simulate a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This is achieved by executing [ARP poisoning or spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing "ARP poisoning/spoofing") to the target computers. When such an attack is successful, all packets between two computers are redirected to a third computer that acts as the man-in-the-middle and is able to intercept the traffic for analysis.

> bettercap is a powerful tool to execute MITM attacks and should be preferred nowadays, instead of ettercap. See also [Why another MITM tool?](https://www.bettercap.org/legacy/#why-another-mitm-tool "Why another MITM tool?") on the bettercap site.

bettercap is available for all major Linux and Unix operating systems and should be part of their respective package installation mechanisms. You need to install it on your host computer that will act as the MITM. On macOS it can be installed by using brew.

```bash
brew install bettercap
```

For Kali Linux you can install bettercap with `apt-get`:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install bettercap
```

There are installation instructions as well for Ubuntu Linux 18.04 on [LinuxHint](https://linuxhint.com/install-bettercap-on-ubuntu-18-04-and-use-the-events-stream/ "Install Bettercap on Ubuntu 18.04").

### Burp Suite

Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing mobile and web applications - <https://portswigger.net/burp/releases>

Its tools work together seamlessly to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of attack surfaces to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities. Burp Proxy operates as a web proxy server for Burp Suite, which is positioned as a man-in-the-middle between the browser and web server(s). Burp Suite allows you to intercept, inspect, and modify incoming and outgoing raw HTTP traffic.

Setting up Burp to proxy your traffic is pretty straightforward. We assume that both your device and host computer are connected to a Wi-Fi network that permits client-to-client traffic.

PortSwigger provides good tutorials on setting up both Android as iOS devices to work with Burp:
